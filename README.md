# mIRC

mIRC script for passport authentication with the Oasiz IRCX chat service.

Instructions:

1. Create free user profile/account: http://oasiz.co/rG
2. Generate API key & password: http://oasiz.co/aA
3. Load oasiz.auth.mrc and oasiz.auth.tool.mrc into mIRC Remotes.
4. Right click mIRC status window, select Oasiz API Auth and click "Add".
5. Follow instructions to add account API details.
6. Connect :-)

Note: It's highly recommended that you do not modify oasiz.auth.mrc in any way, as this file is designed to be swapped/replaced over should there be connection and/or authentication changes made to the chat service. You have been warned!
